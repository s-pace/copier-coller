# couper-coller Manifesto

![couper-coller](/manifesto.png)

## Starting with the why?

- **Remove the cost**:

  - Transport (mass-production)
  - Long-delivery (and print) only when needed
  - Focus on reducing waste and improving efficiency

- **Democratize 3D printing**: Make the technology accessible to everyone, promoting creativity and innovation in communities.

- **Connect people**: Use 3D printing as a tool to bring people together, fostering collaboration and shared experiences.

## One Question: **HOW?**

- Empower a community driven by innovation, passion, and sharing.
- Initiate an entry point for new members and experts to bring their projects to life.
- Print only what you need, as close as possible from a fellow maker.

couper-coller is committed to advancing these goals to create a more sustainable and interconnected world through the power of 3D printing.

_Cet article est basé sur le manifeste de couper-coller, visant à transformer la production et connecter les communautés grâce à l'impression 3D._
